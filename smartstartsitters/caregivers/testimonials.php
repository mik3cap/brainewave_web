      <p class="subhead_blue">Read More About Sitter's Experiences Working With Us</p>

      <p><i>"Working with Smart Start Sitters has been all that I could ask
	  for in a sitter service.  I moved to New York for Columbia
	  University's Masters Program in Speech Language Pathology, with
	  a lot of caregiving experience, but without local sitting connections.
	  As a graduate student, my schedule isn't always ideal, but
	  Melody Rubie worked with me personally to find sitting jobs that fit
	  my interests and availability. Most importantly, I was delighted to
	  find that my background and philosophy of positive caregiving was
	  echoed by Smart Start Sitters."</i></p>

      <p><b>Charity</b></p>

      <p><i>"I am continually impressed by SSS's loyalty; it does not
	only take excellent care of its clients, it takes excellent care of
	its employees. Melody keeps everyone happy, everyone's needs are
	somehow always met, and she does it all with a true serenity, an
	absolute joy for all the people - clients and
	employees alike - that are involved with this wonderful
	organization."</i></p>

      <p><b>Bianca</b></p>

      <p><i>"I have had a great experience working with Smart Start
      Sitters. They have been delightful and supportive. They made the
      effort to match me with families that were my right fit, forming
      a relationship with the sitters and families on a personal
      level. This care for the clients and sitters makes them more
      than just a babysitting service. They care about those they work
      with."</i></p>

      <p><b>Julianna</b></p>

      <p><i>"Smart Start Sitters fosters a great working environment. As
      a sitter, I always feel supported by Melody and the company
      through the diverse sitting experience that Smart Start Sitters
      offers. It's a rarity to find a company that is so willing
      to listen to, and support, their workers as Smart Start Sitters does."</i></p>

      <p><b>Debbie</b></p>

      <p><i>"I have been a Smart Start Sitter since February of this
      year. Nearly a year ago I graduated from Oberlin College with a
      degree in English, and I know well the unstable, challanging and
      yet exciting path that recent college graduates face. For many
      of my friends and myself, the post-collegiate landscape has been
      composed of internships, part-time jobs, grad-school
      applications and a search for a full-time job. While these
      experiences are often rich and rewarding, and lead us toward
      future achievement, they also create a strong need for a steady
      income, even if only a partial one. For me, this need was
      wonderfully met through Smart Start Sitters."</i></p>

      <p><i>"Working as a sitter not only allows a rare level of
      flexibility, but it is a chance to do something that is active,
      social and rewarding all at the same time. When I work I really
      feel that I am using the knowledge I acquired through my
      education in a positive way - namely to help nurture and assist
      a child."</i></p>

      <p><i>"I decided to work through Smart Start Sitters because I got
      the immediate impression (which proved to be quite accurate!)
      that it is an organized, responsible and most of all fair
      operation. I always feel confident that the company will support
      me if I ever need it, and communication is always very friendly
      and clear."</i></p>

      <p><i>"My experience has been very positive, and I encourage you to
      reach out to Smart Start Sitters, even if only for more
      information. I'm sure that when you do, you will get that same
      feeling in your gut, as I did, that you are in good hands!"</i></p>
