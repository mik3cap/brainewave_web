      <p><b><i>Q. Why should I get verified by Smart Start
      Sitters?</i></b><br />

	A. Our extensive vetting process is a great assurance to
	parents looking for excellent care for their children. It
	shows professionalism and initiative on the part of the
	caregiver to have the completed vetting profile to present
	potential clients and in turn, will make clients more willing
	to seriously consider working with you.</p>

      <p><b><i>Q.  Can I run a background check on myself?</i></b><br />

	A. Yes, in fact parents feel more trusting of a sitter who can
	show they have a passed a background check. </p>
