      <p><i>Smart Start Sitters has been a pleasure to work for. This is a unique babysitting agency that respects and honors the rights of a sitter as much as the paying families looking for their service. All of the families I have worked with have been satisfied with the service and have asked for more. Smart Start Sitters takes away the stress of finding someone to care for your family. When you put your trust in Smart Start Sitters you are taking care of your family.</i></p>
      <p><b>Daisey / NYC</b></p>

      <p><i>Smart Start Sitters provides a support system in which strong, lasting relationships can develop between families and sitters! It is a joy working for such a responsible, thoughtful and nurturing company!</i></p>
