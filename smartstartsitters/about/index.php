	Melody Rubie worked with a diverse array of children in public
	school systems, before founding Smart Start Sitters. Her
	teaching experience encompassed working with children on the
	autism spectrum and with cerebral palsy, those with emotional
	and mental challenges, as well as the general education
	population, by helping to modify articulation production,
	vocal impairments, stuttering, and language delays. Melody's
	passion for child development lead her to participate in
	numerous parenting workshops at Barnard's Center for Toddler
	Development and to regularly attend child development seminars
	at Bank Street College of Education and the City University of
	New York. She is a member of The National Association for the
	Education of Young Children, a professional organization
	dedicated to spreading child development concepts and
	information to educators, caregivers and parents. Melody's
	passion for and knowledge of early childhood
	development–starting with her own child–inspired her to create
	Smart Start Sitters to fill the same needs and desires of
	other parents.</p>

       <p>Melody is active in her local business community and frequently 
	involved in events on childcare, child development, and
	Mompreneurship. She is the mother of a young son as well as an
	accomplished principal opera singer and musical theater performer both
	on Broadway and in Europe. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and
	son.</p>

      <p class="header_2">Melody’s Story</p>
      <p style="color: #ffffff;"><i><b>When my son was born, I didn’t realize I would need a sitter. I was
	  so busy preparing for the birth, tending to my newborn's needs, and
	  getting acclimated to motherhood, that I hadn't thought about who
	  would care for my child when my maternity leave ended. I asked friends
	  for recommendations and, while interviewing numerous candidates,
	  discovered that how a candidate responded to me in an interview was
	  not indicative of how she might respond to my child. I quickly
	  developed a way to refine my interviewing skills to discern the
	  qualities of a child-centric sitter and to conduct effective
	  background and reference checks. Not only did I find excellent care
	  for my son, I also began helping other parents find great sitters,
	  too. Since launching Smart Start Sitters in 2008, I have used my
	  experience to provide hundreds of parents with qualified sitters who
	  have helped their children grow and thrive.</b></i></p>
