SmartStartSitters.com's use of general member information
Two things drive SmartStartSitters.com's decisions regarding the use of information collected from SmartStartSitters.com members generally: 1) improving user experience by offering personalized services, content and advertising, and 2) market research.

Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and SmartStartSitters.com believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. SmartStartSitters.com uses information collected from SmartStartSitters.com members to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them.

In addition to banner ads, SmartStartSitters.com may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide.

SmartStartSitters.com may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained through cookies or third parties to direct services and content based on your interests. SmartStartSitters.com reserves the right to collect market research data in order to generate sales to corporate clients. However, market research data may be used at the aggregate level to: 

1. Improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of SmartStartSitters.com members
2. Increase the likelihood that a group's experience on SmartStartSitters.com is relevant to its interests as a whole
3. Formulate group-level statistical models that are used to accomplish goal #2 (above).

SmartStartSitters.com's market research may be collected in some of the following ways:

1. Among individuals who opt-in to take surveys during the registration process or while on SmartStartSitters.com (those who sign up are contacted and take surveys through email)
3. Through contests that are offered on the site
4. Through general use of the site 

SmartStartSitters.com uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to SmartStartSitters.com members who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to members who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from a statistical analysis.

If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify member information by erasing it from our database.

With whom does SmartStartSitters.com share information?
When you submit information to SmartStartSitters.com, it is generally collected, processed and maintained solely by us. Sometimes we may allow partner companies to collect information about members from us or directly from you (through their Web site). When SmartStartSitters.com is the source, it is usually so that we can provide a service with a partner. We choose to work with companies that we believe to be upstanding and that we believe will treat your information responsibly. But, since we don't own these companies, we can't speak for them on privacy issues. Before telling them about yourself, check out their privacy statements. If you are not satisfied with their information practices, you can choose to not use their service.

Below is a summary of some of the situations in which SmartStartSitters.com might share some of the information that we collect from users:

Co-Branding
Some of our services, such as SmartStartSitters.com email, are offered in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide these services, SmartStartSitters.com may choose to share some of you user data (e.g., including, but not limited to, user name and email address).

Content Partners
Some SmartStartSitters.com content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. SmartStartSitters.com typically shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, etc.) collected on the site or via email surveys with these partners. This information is typically aggregate and not linked to specific users. 

Partner Sponsorships

Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require
you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone
number. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information
about yourself. If you don't want these sponsors to have your personal
information, you can choose to not participate.

When visitors come to SmartStartSitters.com, they may receive cookies
from SmartStartSitters.com's sponsors; this information is typically
not shared with SmartStartSitters.com. This privacy statement does not
address the information practices of our advertisers. You should read
the privacy statements of all third-party sites, as their privacy
policies may differ from SmartStartSitters.com's.

Finally, SmartStartSitters.com reserves the right to disclose user
information from both private and public areas of the site at our
discretion to anyone or no one at all, if required by law or if given
reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing
injury to or interference with the rights of SmartStartSitters.com
members or the general public, or with SmartStartSitters.com's rights
of property. Please be advised, however, that all information
submitted by you to SmartStartSitters.com becomes the property of
SmartStartSitters.com. By submitting this information, you do hereby
agree to allow SmartStartSitters.com to use such information at its
sole discretion pursuant to the terms of the Terms of use.

Specifically, we may also share certain information about you with
those of our vendors who are responsible for handling your account or
performing other necessary services that you require. Although we may
share sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers,
banking information), security information (e.g., account passwords)
and personal communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages or message
board postings) with such vendors where necessary and appropriate, we
will not share such information with other third parties, except in
response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in
connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly
relating to a domain name registration or other services we provide.

Additionally, we may share the information stored in our database, as
well as other information that is not of a sensitive nature, with
carefully selected business partners, including those who offer
services that complement those provided by us or which may otherwise
be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share information
about you with our business partners, you may send us an e-mail at
support@sittercity.com. Include the word "privacy" in the subject line
of the e-mail and all your registration information in the body of the
e-mail. Finally, SmartStartSitters.com reserves the right to transfer,
sell and/or distribute all information collected on its sight for any
purpose, including, but not limited to, for satisfaction of any debt
or upon liquidation of the company should such a situation arise.

SmartStartSitters.com's opt-in/out policy

So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are
certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter

register as SmartStartSitters.com members, we need to take reasonable
measures to preserve the accuracy of our members' ages. Please contact
us at support@sittercity.com to find out how to change information you
cannot access through your Profile.

Our databases automatically update any personal information you edit

property of SmartStartSitters.com upon submission. Keep this in mind
if you decide to communicate personal information through any of these
applications.

SmartStartSitters.com and the protection of children's privacy

SmartStartSitters.com is intended for people 18 or over. Our
registration process is intentionally designed to identify children
under 18 years of age. We have also made an effort to specifically
limit SmartStartSitters.com's appeal to people of age 18 and
older. SmartStartSitters.com will not knowingly collect any
information from children under 13.

If it comes to our attention that a member has revealed, on
SmartStartSitters.com, that they are under 18, a member of
SmartStartSitters.com's staff will immediately close their account.

Note to parents If your child is under 18 and has become a
SmartStartSitters.com member using a false age, please notify us at
support@sittercity.com so that we can immediately close the account
and nullify all personally identifiable information collected from
them. If your child is under the age of 18 and you would like to know
more about our site, information practices, stored information on your
child, or how to close your child's account, contact
SmartStartSitters.com's staff at support@sittercity.com. In both
instances, you will need to provide your full name, address, phone
number, e-mail address and child's user name.
