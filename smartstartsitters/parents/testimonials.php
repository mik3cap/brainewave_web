<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Well, once again you have come through in
a huge way for us - The sitter was great! She was everything you said
she'd be and more. I returned home to a happy, well fed toddler
who appeared to not have missed me one bit. Thank you for providing
such quality babysitting services at a moment's notice. I am
more and more impressed with your network of sitters the more I meet
them.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Jennifer / NYC</b></p>

<p><i>We adored the sitter. She was great at engaging [my child] and
making me feel comfortable enough to enjoy our date! (A minor
miracle, if you know me...) My child really liked her.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>T.C. / NYC</b></p>

<p><i>Your sitters were absolutely amazing. They had a few more charges
than expected and handled it with grace. They were fun, creative,
positive and responsive. I will absolutely call upon you to provide
sitters for my future clients.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Katie, Green Apple Weddings / NYC</b></p>

<p><i>My child adored the sitter (so did I actually). You have managed to find such great people to be your sitters.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Wendy / NYC</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Your sitter handled the day like a pro. A
college graduate, her background is in music so she was happy to sing
and dance with my girls. A perfect match!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Nicole / BKLYN</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>We love your sitter and will for sure use your agency in the future!!!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Jenny / NYC</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Everything went great with your sitter!
She is so sweet! I was done and home at 11:30 so I went ahead and took
advantage of having a sitter there and went to a yoga class. It was
wonderful!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Kelley / NYC</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Everything went wonderfully!!! I got
loads of compliments from my guests that the kids had a great time and
that the girls [Smart Start Sitters] were fantastic. We will for sure
pass on your info to anyone and everyone who asks.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Mackenzie - Special Event / NYC</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>Another star in your circle! Your sitter
was right on time, prepared with math logic word puzzles for my
children... We are very impressed with your sitters - bright,
involved, responsible women.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Susan, LCSW / NYC</b></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>The college graduate that Melody found
our family is absolutely amazing. She is intelligent, hard working and
kind. She thoroughly engages our toddler. We are so appreciative.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Marie-Ann / NYC</b><br />
</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i>"Smart Start Sitters is a blessing.  I
use the service for those last minute or occasional times when I need
babysitting coverage. Melody takes the stress out of finding an
available sitter even with just 24 hour notice (which is usually the
circumstance I am in). And I know whoever she books for me will be
terrific. My daughter has loved all the sitters and the reason is
that they engage with her and typically have a wonderful rapport with
kids. Thank you Melody!"</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><b>Jane / NYC</b></p>

<p><span class="subhead_blue">Mom Trends NYC</span></p>
<p><i>"When our babysitter announced she was getting married and needed
three weeks off, we panicked.  We imagined scrambling to line up
family and friends to help cover some childcare needs.  Coincidently I
received an email from a new babysitting service called Smart Start
Sitters.  I've heard of companies providing temporary help, but this
one was different: They recruit sitters from child-centric locations
such as early childhood development programs."</i></p>
