      <span class="subhead_blue">Understanding What Kids Need and Parents Want</span>

      <p>Today's parents want a sitter who is not only caring and reliable,
	but who also engages with children in ways that foster their
	emotional, social, and intellectual development. Smart Start Sitters
	seeks out and trains a select staff of sitters who provide the care
	and nurturing that parents themselves would give to their own
	children. That's why <b>Smart Start Sitters</b> are the next best thing to
	mom and dad!</p>

      <p>More than just a babysitting service, <b>Smart Start Sitters</b> advocates
	positive caregiving and provides educational opportunities for our
	sitters. Regular workshops, often presented by leaders in the field of
	child development, ensure that our sitters are trained to understand
	and appropriately meet the needs of each child in their care.</p>

      <p class="header_2">What is Positive Caregiving?</p>

      <p>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) defines this as caregivers who: </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Have a positive, cheerful attitude
	      <li>Are attentive and respond to a child's vocalizations
	      <li>Show interest and talk with the child about what they're doing
	    </ul>
	  </td>
	  <td style="vertical-align:top;">
	    <ul>
	      <li>Tell age-appropriate stories
	      <li>Sing and play with the child
	      <li>Encourage and nurture their charges in their endeavors
