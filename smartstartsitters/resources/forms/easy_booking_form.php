<p>"Many features make for quality child care. Some of these features
include adult-to-child ratio, group size, and the language a caregiver
uses with a child. among predictors of child care quality, one of the
strongest and most consistent predictor of children's development is
the extent and the degree to which caregivers provided positive
caregiving. NICHD SECCYD researchers looked at all the different
caregiver behaviors that make up positive caregiving and found that
these behaviors were linked to features of quality care that can be
regulated, such as adult-to-child ratio.</p>

<p>Using a checklist... similar to the measurements used by NICHD SECCYD
researchers, parents and families can focus on their children's
experiences in the child care setting (either the one they are
considering or the one their child is currently in).</p>

<p>To use this checklist when visiting your child's child care location:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to your child's caregiver to let him or her know that you will
be stopping by sometime during the week to watch your child in the
child care setting. If your child is not yet in the child care setting
you wish to observe, contact the child care provider and ask if you
can visit the child care setting; then select one child to watch
during your visit.

<li>Sit off to the side of the setting and let the child and the
caregiver go through their day as they normally do. Don't interrupt
the play or change the situation in any way, if possible.

<li>Use a watch or timer to keep track of a set amount of time for
watching your child and the caregiver together. Try an hour, or maybe
30 minutes.

<li>Mark the sheet each time the caregiver does one of the actions on the list.

<li>When time is up, go back through your record sheet and add ratings
for each behavior the caregiver completed. Use the ratings provided on
the next page.

<li>Add up how often the caregiver did each of the items on the list,
and then get an overall total.
</ol>

<p>If the caregiver does many of the items on the checklist, or does them
often, then the caregiver is probably providing a more positive
caregiving environment, which suggests that your child is getting
higher quality child care. this type of environment encourages the
child to grow and learn and can help him or her build important
skills.</p>

<p>If you counted the caregiver doing each action only once in a
30-minute period, or if you rate the caregiver as doing one or more
behaviors hardly any of the time, you may want to talk to the
caregiver about including positive interactions with your child more
often.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The positive caregiving checklist is not meant to be the
only measure of quality care, nor is it intended to take the place of
other guidelines or standards for quality care."</p>
